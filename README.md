# Samples.Specifications

One of the missing points in the software development cycle often lies in the gap that develops over time between the initial product specifications, as stated by the product managers and their actual implementation/interpretation as carried out by the developers. 
This can be addressed by creating a unit/integration test suite which will provide a safe net for future changes. However having only unit/integration tests will preserve the gap as the product managers are not familiar with the code and the actual testing/isolation frameworks that the developers chose to use, if any. 
Therefore there's a need in **bridging** between the product managers/business experts and the development team. 
This issue can be addressed by using a dedicated behavior-specifying framework.
